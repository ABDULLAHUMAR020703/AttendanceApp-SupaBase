# 2. Select your project
# 3. Go to Settings > API
# 4. Copy the "Project URL" to EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
# 5. Copy the "anon" or "public" key (NOT service_role) to EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
# 6. Save this file as .env (without .example)
# 7. Restart your Expo development server after creating .env

# Important Notes:
# - The EXPO_PUBLIC_ prefix is required for Expo to expose these variables to your app
# - These keys are safe to expose in client code (they're public keys)
